        Determine if two sentences contradict
        each other using the power of artificial intelligence! ðŸ¤–
    </h3>
    <p>
        After you enter two sentences and press the arrow, 
        we send a request to a server running in the cloud. <br>
        This server loads the tokenizer needed to parse the 
        sentences into something the AI can understand. <br>
        The model's base comes from <a 
                                    href="http://huggingface.co" 
                                    target="_blank"

        with a custom classification layer I made attached to it. <br>
        The model was trained using datasets from sources such as Stanford
        NLP.

    <p>
        This model as a few quirks, for example, if the first sentence is
        "To be or not to be, that is the question" then it thinks that 
        "Not to be is an answer to that question" is a contradiction
